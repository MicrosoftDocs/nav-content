**IMPORTANT**: This content is no longer actively maintained. We encourage you to check out Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation for recent updates. Dynamics 365 Business Central is the next version of Dynamics NAV and adds more capabilities, including the option to migrate to the cloud. For more information, see [Welcome to Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central) and [Configuring the Help Experience for Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/configure-help).

## Source files for documentation

Welcome to the repository for the application help content for Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018! Dynamics NAV has been aimed at small and midsized businesses, and this repo gives you access to the source files that were used to build the application help that is shipped with Dynamics NAV 2018.  

There are different repos in GitHub for the source content and each of the languages that Microsoft translates to. The *nav-content* repo contains the content in English (US). If you want access to the content in other languages, navigate to the relevant repo - the names follow this pattern: *nav-content.<language>-<country>*, such as [nav-content.da-DK](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/nav-content.da-DK) for the Danish version.

**NOTE**: As of October 2021, Microsoft no longer accepts pull requests to the *nav-content* repo, nor to the language-specific repos.
