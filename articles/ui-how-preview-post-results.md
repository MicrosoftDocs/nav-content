# How to: Preview Posting Results
On every document and journal that can be posted, you can choose the **Preview Posting** button to review the different types of entries that will be created when you post the document or journal.

## To preview G/L entries that will result from posting a purchase invoice
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a purchase invoice. For more information, see [How to: Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. Choose **Preview Posting**.
4. In the **Posting Preview** window, select **G/L Entry**, and then choose **Show Related Entries**.  
The **G/L Entries Preview** window shows which entries will be created when you post the purchase invoice.
