# Manage Bank Accounts
At regular intervals, you must reconcile your bank ledger entries in Dynamics NAV with the related bank transactions in bank accounts at your bank, and then post the balance to your bank account. You can perform this task either as part of processing the payments represented on a bank statement in the **Payment Reconciliation Journal**. Alternatively, you can perform the task separately from payment processing, in the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** window, which supports check ledger entries. In both cases, you fill the windows by importing the bank statement into Dynamics NAV.

Sometimes, you need to transfer amounts between bank account in Dynamics NAV to reflect transfers at your bank. You perform this task in the **General Journal** window, in different ways depending on the currency of the funds.

Before you can manage bank accounts, you must set each bank account up as a bank account card. In addition, you must set up electronic services that you may use for bank statement import and payment file export. For more information, see [Set Up Bank Accounts](bank-setup-banking.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
