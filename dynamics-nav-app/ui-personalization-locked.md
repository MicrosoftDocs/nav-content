# Why is the page is locked from personalizing?
If there is a lock icon in the **Personalizing** banner when you open a page (as shown), this means that you are currently prevented from making any more personalization changes to the page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)].

![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-locked.png "Personalize lock")

There can be two reasons for this:
1.  Until now, you have only used the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] to personalize the page.

2. You have used the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] to personalize the page before, but it was done using a [!INCLUDE[nav2017](includes/nav2017.md)] or earlier version.   

If you want to continue personalizing the page by using the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)], choose the lock icon, and then **Unlock**.

## What happens when you unlock the page
If you choose to unlock the page, the current personalization of the page in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] will be cleared, meaning the page will go back to its original layout and you will have to start from scratch.

In the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)], the page will remain as it was before and will not be effected by the new changes in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. The personalization in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] becomes separated, so you will now have a personalized version in each client. 

In the future, you will personalize the page in the two clients separately. Therefore, the page can potentially look different between the two.
