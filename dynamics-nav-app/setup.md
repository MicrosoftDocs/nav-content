# Set Up Your Dynamics NAV
Dynamics NAV includes a standard configuration of most business processes, but you can change the configuration to suit your business' needs.
From your Home page, you can access assisted setup guides that help you configure certain scenarios. For more information, see [Welcome to Dynamics NAV](across-get-started.md).
