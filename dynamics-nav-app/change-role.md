# Description on How To Change the Role Center
The Home page is your main point of entry into [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. Here you can get an overview of the daily work tasks and their status. Tasks that you perform often are accessed through the tiles in the content area, the navigation pane on the left, and through actions in the ribbon.

The content on the Home page is based on the selected Role Center. The standard Role Center for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is **Business Manager**, but you can change this and choose between a number of Role Centers.

## Changing the Role Center: Instructions
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose **My Settings**.
2. In the **My Settings** window, in the **Role Center** field, select the Role Center that you want to set as the standard. For example, select **Accountant**.
3. Choose the **OK** button.
