    questions:
      - question: |
          What email address can I use with Dynamics NAV?
        answer: |
          Dynamics NAV requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. Dynamics NAV does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.  
          
          If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up](ui-troubleshoot-self-signup.md).  
          
      - question: |
          Do I have to buy Microsoft 365?
        answer: |
          No. But if you want to experience Dynamics NAV as fully integrated with Microsoft 365, you can sign up for a 1-month free trial of Microsoft 365 [here](https://products.office.com/try).  
          
      - question: |
          What is the integration with Microsoft 365 about?
        answer: |
          Dynamics NAV is fully integrated with Microsoft 365 so that you can navigate freely between Microsoft 365 apps and Dynamics NAV using the app launcher. In Dynamics NAV, you can open data in Excel, print reports using Word, and you can work with your Dynamics NAV data in Outlook, for example. For more information, see [Using [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] as your Business Inbox in Outlook](across-outlook.md).  
          
      - question: |
          Can I cancel my subscription?
        answer: |
          Yes, but depending on how you signed up to Dynamics NAV, your data can be deleted or preserved. For more information, see [Canceling Dynamics NAV](madeira-cancel.md).  
          
      - question: |
          Where do I go if I have questions?
        answer: |
          If you have questions about Dynamics NAV that you can't find an answer for in this documentation, you can ask the Dynamics NAV community. For more information, see [Dynamics NAV, Business edition community](https://community.dynamics.com/business). Also, our Support team post tips and tricks.

      - question: |
          Is it possible to extend my 30-day “New Company” trial period?
        answer: |
          Yes. If you want to extend your trial, you should contact Microsoft at 1-888-477-7989 (US) or 1-800-741-9206 (Canada). NOTE:  It may take up to 2 business days to complete the trial extension process.  
          
      - question: |
          Our administrator has moved me to another plan to give me another role, but I still see the same Home page in Dynamics NAV?
        answer: |
          This is a bit complicated, but it looks like your administrator didn't change your Role Center and assign user groups that match the new license. Essentially, your access to Dynamics NAV is determined by the type of plan (license) that you have - this sets permissions and your default Home page. You can change your Role Center manually in My Settings, but if you are moved to another plan, such as moving you from the Business plan to the Team Members plan, you might see the old Home because your permissions were not changed.  
          
      - question: |
          Why can't I find that capability in my Dynamics NAV?
        answer: |
          Did you read about a new capability in the roadmap or on our blog recently? In that case, your Dynamics NAV might not have been upgraded to the latest version yet. If the capability is published as an extension in AppSource, then there is a delay between the extension being announced and its availability in AppSource.
