You use an external service provider to exchange electronic documents with your trading partners. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).  

## To set up a document exchange service  
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Doc. Exch. Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**User Agent**|Enter any text that can be used to identify your company in document exchange processes.|  
    |**Doc. Exch. Tenant ID**|Enter the tenant in the document exchange service that represents your company. This is provided by the document exchange service provider.|  
    |**Enabled**|Specify if the service is enabled. **Note:**  As soon as you enable the service, at least two job queue entries are created to process the traffic of electronic documents in and out of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. When you disable the service, the job queue entries are deleted.|  
    |**Signup URL**|Specify the web page where you sign up for the document exchange service.|

> [!NOTE]  
>  It is recommended that you protect the logon information that you enter in the **VAN Service Setup** window. You can encrypt data on the server by generating new or importing existing encryption keys that you enable on the server instance that connects to the database. This is described in the following procedure.  

## To encrypt your logon information  
1. In the **VAN Service Setup** window, choose the **Encryption Management** action.  
2. In the **Data Encryption Management** window, enable encryption of your data. <!--For more information, see [Manage Data Encryption](../manage-data-encryption.md).-->
