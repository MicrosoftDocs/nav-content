# How to: File SEPA Payments
In [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)], you can use Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) credit transfers to file SEPA payments with the bank.  

SEPA unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions, which makes international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. European citizens and companies can make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations, regardless of location.  

Before you can file a SEPA payment you must complete the following administration tasks:  

- Set up a new export protocol. For more information, see Export Protocol.  
- In the **Country/Region** table, select the **SEPA Allowed** field for each country that belongs to the EEA zone.  
- Verify that the **Currency Euro** field in the **General Ledger Setup** table corresponds with the currency in the payment lines.  
- Verify that the vendorâ€™s **Preferred Bank Account** field in the **Vendor** table contains the IBAN and SWIFT code.  

## To file a SEPA payment  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **File SEPA Payments**, and then choose the related link.
