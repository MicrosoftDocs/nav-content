# How to: Set Up Salespeople
Many companies want to follow an individual employee's performance as a basis for calculating the sales commission or bonus. See, for example, the Salesperson Commissions report. A company may also want to assign a salesperson to each of their contacts.

When yo have set up a salesperson in the **Salespeople** window, you can select it in the **Salesperson Code** field on all relevant records, such as G/L account, customer, vendor, contacts, and campaign cards. Then, when you post or set up invoices, credit memos, journal lines, finance-setup charge activities, and so on, the salesperson code is carried to the resulting ledger entries.

## To set up a salesperson code
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Salespeople**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Salespeople** window, choose the **New** action.
