# Microsoft Dynamics NAV  Extensions by Other Providers
At [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you can get extensions for [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)]. Some extensions are provided by Microsoft, and other extensions are provided by other companies. We refer to the websites that these companies provide for more information about the extensions that are not published by Microsoft. You can find this information at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?product=dynamics-365%3Bdynamics-365-for-financials&page=1).  

The list of the extensions by other companies grows each month. So keep an eye out for [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?product=dynamics-365%3Bdynamics-365-for-financials&page=1) and get apps to help you in your work in [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)].
