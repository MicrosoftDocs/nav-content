# Manage Inventory
For each physical product that you trade in you must create an item card of type Inventory. Items that you offer to customers but do not keep in inventory you can register as nonstock items, which you can convert to inventory items when necessary. You can increase or decrease the quantity of an item in inventory by posting directly to the item ledger entries, for example, after a physical count or if you do not record purchases.

Inventory increases and decreases are naturally also recorded when you post purchase and sales documents respectively. For more information, see [How to: Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md), [How to: Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md), and [How to: Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

To increase your overview of items and to help you find them, you can categorize items and give them attributes to search and sort by.   

**Note**: In Dynamics NAV, a product is referred to using the term “item”.
