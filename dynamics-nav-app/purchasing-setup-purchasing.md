# Set Up Purchasing
Before you can manage purchase processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's purchase policies.

First, you must define the general setup, such as which purchase documents are required and how their values are posted. This general setup is typically performed once during the initial implementation.

A separate series of tasks related to creating vendor master data is to record the vendors' discount and price agreements in windows linked to the vendor cards.

The periodic activity of creating vendor cards for new vendors is covered in the Manage Purchasing section. For more information, see [How to: Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).

Finance-related purchase setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the Finance Setup section. For more information, see [Set Up Finance](finance-setup-setup-finance-setup.md).
