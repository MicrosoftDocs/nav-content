# Using Search for Page or Report
You can find any page, report, or view by using the **Search for Page or Report** icon in the top right corner of the address bar.
When you start typing characters, a drop-down list shows page names containing the character(s) you type. The drop-down list changes as you type more characters, and you can select the correct page from the list when it is displayed. The second column in the drop-down list shows the navigation paths to the found pages.

**Note**: The **Search for Page or Report** does not search through data, such as customer names, addresses, or transactions. To search for data, you can use the search associated with the page; this is illustrated with the magnifier symbol placed in the page top right corner. For information on using this type of search, see [Entering Criteria in Filters](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
