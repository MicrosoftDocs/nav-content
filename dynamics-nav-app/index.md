> [!NOTE]
> This Help library is not being updated regularly. This is because Dynamics NAV is gradually being replaced by Dynamics Business Central.<br /
> To learn about recent functionality, which also exists in NAV, go to the Help library for Business Central, which is structured in the same way: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/ <br />
> Note that many descriptions of general client capabilities are different, because Business Central is a cloud product.
