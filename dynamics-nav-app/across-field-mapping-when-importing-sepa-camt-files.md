# Field Mapping When Importing SEPA CAMT Files
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] supports the regional SEPA standards (Single Euro Payments Area) for importing SEPA bank statements (CAMT format). For more information, see [How to: Set Up the Bank Data Conversion Service](bank-how-setup-bank-data-conversion-service.md).  

 The SEPA CAMT standard itself has local variations. Therefore, you may have to modify the generic data exchange definition (represented by the **SEPA CAMT** code in the **Posting Exchange Definitions** window) to adapt it to a local variation of the standard. The following tables show the element-to-field mapping for tables 81, 273, and 274 in the SEPA CAMT implementation in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].  

 For information about creating or adjusting a data exchange definition, see [How to: Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

 Elements in the **Ntry** node that are imported into [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] but not mapped to any fields are stored in the **Posting Exch. Column Def** table. Users can view these elements from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal**, **Payment Application**, and **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** windows by choosing the **Bank Statement Line Details** action.
